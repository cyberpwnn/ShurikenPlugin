# ShurikenPlugin
A great start to a bloated but capable plugin.

#### To rename this template please do the following simple steps

1. Update the properties in build.gradle in the designated section
2. In settings.gradle, change the name from "APlugin" to your project name
3. Use SHIFT+F6 on the package pkg (in src/java/main) to your package
4. Use SHIFT+F6 on the class APlugin (in src/main/java) to your project name
5. Update the getTag() function in the main plugin class to your project name
6. Invalidate Caches/Restart (Because JetBricks RetardiJ cache eviction sucks)
